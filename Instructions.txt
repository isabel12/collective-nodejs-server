README - Instructions
---------------------

Server
-------

The server is on GitHub at https://github.com/isabel12/collective-nodejs-server
The readme has a very detailed API description.

The server is running on Heroku at:
https://nodejs-collective-server.herokuapp.com/

To run the server on LocalHost:

1. You need to have installed and be running MongoDB, listening on localhost:50791.  
2. You need to install node (should be easy, http://nodejs.org/)
3. The server '.zipp' extension needs to be renamed to 'zip', and extracted. It should contain all modules already.
4. type the following command: 
	$ node web.js


Client
------

The Client is on GitHub at https://github.com/ehinger/collective-client

The design guys have a different deadline for this (tomorrow), so will submit this late as they haven't uploaded yet..
